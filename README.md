# ErrataMusicalia

A place to collect Errata lists for all kinds of musicalia.

## Directory structure & naming conventions

All file and directory names must be ASCII only, with single dashes instead of spaces. Double dashes may be used to disambiguate pseudo-spaces from actual dashes.

1.  Composer

    in the form `Surname,_First_Second`. If the surname is present only once, further names should usually be omitted.

2.  Catalogue

    Use the shortest common abbreviations like BWV, K, in the common capitalisation.
    opus is abbreviated as `op`.
    If for a composer it is uncommon or unnecessary to refer to their works by catalogue number, this directory level should be omitted; individual works to which this applies should be placed next to the catalogue directories.

3.  Work title

    If the work is in a catalogue directory, the work title is prepended by its number in that catalogue.

4.  Edition

    Each data file collects entries for one manuscript or print, which should be identified unambiguously by the file name.
    The following abbreviations may be used:

    aut – autograph
    ms – manuscript
    mss – manuscripts
    fs – full score
    vs – vocal score
    pt – vocal or instrumental part
    fe – first edition
    common abbreviations e.g. for complete works editions, library sigla etc.

## Further policies

Always use scientific pitch notation, with ‘middle c’ corresponding to c4, 32 foot C corresponding to c0, cb''' corresponding to cb6, etc.
Don’t refer to any bar numbering or rehearsal marks not present in the source, unless necessary.
